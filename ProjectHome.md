# Introduction #
This project was created to demonstrate how to use [jsPlumb](http://code.google.com/p/jsplumb/) to connect GWT widgets.

## Demo ##
To see a demonstration go to: http://gwtjsplumb.appspot.com.

The actual demo doesn't look so exciting, but if you've been trying to get javascript libraries such as jQuery and jQueryUI to work with GWT you'll know what I'm talking about.  I've always liked GWT for its widget library and its ability to create web applications without knowing any javascript; however some functions such as simple drag-and-drop and connecting widgets alluded me.  I looked at the ease and power of jQuery and jsPlumb and thought why can't GWT do that.

Well you can have the best of both worlds thanks to JSNI.  Below are the high level steps.  Click on the links to see the actual code.
